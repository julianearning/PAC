# Description  

Some exercises for Parallel Computing for the University of Applied Sciences Niederrhein. 
Mostly in C, except estimate of pi which is in C++. 

- Barrier using C-Threads  
- Mandelbrot in Master/Worker using OpenMPI  
- Approximation of Pi in OpenMP  
- PingPong-communication with OpenMPI  
- Ring-Communication with OpenMPI  
   

For the PingPong-Communication some unwanted behaviour was found, it would be 
better to repeat it several times and use the average of the times.
